Summary of my research
------
I have joined in the School of Mathematical Sciences, Chongqing Normal University from September 2019. Prior to joining CQNU, I was a post doctor working with Professor Liwei Xu for 2 years in the School of Mathematical Sciences, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.  I was born in Luzhou, Sichuan province, China.  I obtained BSc in mathematics  and MSc in convex optimization from Chongqing Normal University in 2005-2012. My PhD study was on stochastic programming supervised by Professor Xinmin Yang. My research interest lies in the stochastic optimization with applications and focuses on the study of the theoretical and computational aspects of optimization algorithms.
